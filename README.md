# Clipboard-Spammer-C-
I was looking to annoy my friends on WhatsApp with some good ol' spam. But, when I looked up some code, I found none. So i decided to whip this up and thought it would be fun. I'm about 1 week into this coding rabbit hole so if the code looks like crap... that's because it is. this bad boy spams whatever is on your clipboard and either presses the the enter key (for notepad and stuff) or clicks your mouse (put your mouse over the send button). you choose how many times the thing happens, the time constant(how fast it happens(the lower, the faster) because, sometimes, it can crash apps if its too fast) and the mode. I made it in c++ because I only know how to code in c++
